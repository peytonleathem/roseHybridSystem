A project to store rose hybridization information for hobbyist rose breeders.

It includes an SQL file, although currently I don't plan to host
any databases except for my own database. If you want to, you can 
use this file as a base for your own database and figure out your own
hosting system.

The accompanying website can again be used locally, make sure to
connect your database and your copy of the website.
